## ❓ Common Questions

### Can I see my friend's answers?

**No.** You can only see if they completed the quiz, not their actual answers or scores.

### What if I miss a day?

You can still take previous days' quizzes. The goal remains active until the duration ends.

### Can I do multiple goals at once?

**Yes!** Create goals with different friends. Each goal is independent.

### What if my friend doesn't accept?

You can decline the pending goal and create a new one with someone else.

### Can I change the language mid-goal?

**No.** Languages are locked when the goal is accepted. Finish the goal and start a new one with a different language.
